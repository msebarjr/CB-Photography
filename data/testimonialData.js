        text: "Being pregnant during a pandemic, I did not feel safe nor beautiful, but Conrad made me feel bot. Not only did he make me feel safe, but he was also able to capture the greatest most signficant time of our life. He captured my vulnerability, our excitement, our nervousness, and was a bright light when the world was such a dark place. I wanted a simple session, not at a beach, and Conrad suggested a park with the most beautiful sceneries and captured our love in such a way that we are lucky to share with our daughter. We were very lucky to have found Conrad as he was extremely professional and compassionate.",

        text: "I first noticed Conrad's headshots on social media and was very impressed. He has a real talent for bringing out out the personality of his subjects. My daughter, who is an actor like me, needed new headshots. She had outgrown her previous photos, which was preventing her from booking work. We could have driven just two hours to New York, but instead, we flew to Florida to give Conrad a try. We are really glad we did! Conrad was incredibly accommodating and fun to work with. he immediately put my daughter at ease ad got some great photos of both of us. I sent the pictures to our agent and she was very excited about the quality and diversity of the shots. Within a few weeks, my daughter booked two commercials! Later this summer, Conrad took some amazing drone shots of a rental property I own. The lighting, composition, and quality were remarkable, These were a great addition to my VRBO listing. Conrad demonstrates his artistry across a wide range of areas including portraits, aerial and landscapes, action sports, and commercial work. We highly recommend him and are eager to work with him again!",
